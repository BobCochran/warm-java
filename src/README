The Learning Java project is intended to be a collection of Java code snippets useful to
beginning Java programmers. The code snippets do not make up a specific software application
either individually or collectively. Instead, they are intended to be complete Java methods 
that can do useful utility functions or which show beginning Java programmers how to 
perform some task. For example, the first code snippet being contributed is a set of
two classes which show how to extract and publish attributes from a JAR file's manifest file.

The files being pushed to the repository were created and pushed by the NetBeans version 
7.2 IDE. If you clone the repository, you may well get the clone in the form of a 
NetBeans project.

List of code snippets:



1. Bobapp2.java -- main class that calls packageVersion.java
2. packageVersion.Java -- searches for and prints manifest file attributes
   to standard output. Specifically, it searches for and prints build date
   and time information, a bundle version number string, and the developer's
   name and email address.
3. build.xml -- Ant task which defines attributes supporting the metadata 
   being extracted above.
